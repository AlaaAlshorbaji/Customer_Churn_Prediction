# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting **customer churn** using supervised machine learning algorithms. The aim is to build a model that can accurately classify whether a customer is likely to leave a service (churn) or stay, based on historical data.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To analyze customer behavior data and apply machine learning models to predict whether a customer will **churn** (i.e., stop using the service).  
This type of prediction is crucial for telecom, banking, subscription-based platforms, and more — to retain users before they leave.

## 🧠 Workflow Overview

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
   - Load dataset (CSV or built-in)
   - Check for missing values, outliers, data types

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizations of churn distribution
   - Correlation between features and target
   - Univariate and bivariate plots

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Encode categorical features (Label Encoding / One-Hot)
   - Normalize or scale numerical features
   - Handle class imbalance (e.g., SMOTE or class weights)
   - Split into training/testing sets

4. **Model Training**
   - Algorithms used may include:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Random Forest
     - Decision Tree
     - XGBoost / LightGBM
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - ROC Curve and AUC Score

6. **Prediction & Interpretation**
   - Predict churn for new customers
   - Analyze most important features
   - Possibly use SHAP or LIME for explainability

## 📈 Results Summary

- All trained models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics.
- **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** typically performed best due to their ability to handle non-linear relationships and feature interactions.
- **Logistic Regression** served as a strong baseline model and showed high interpretability.
- Visualizations such as the confusion matrix and ROC curve provided clear insights into classification performance.

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- Contract type, tenure, and monthly charges were among the most predictive features for churn.
- Customers on month-to-month contracts or with high monthly charges were more likely to churn.
- Categorical encoding and handling class imbalance significantly improved model accuracy and recall on minority classes (churned customers).

---

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Apply hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV` or `Optuna` for optimal performance.
- Use ensemble models or stacking to combine multiple classifiers.
- Add more behavioral features (e.g., usage frequency, customer support interactions).
- Integrate SHAP or LIME for more transparent model explanations.
- Build a user-facing dashboard using Streamlit or Dash to deploy the prediction model interactively.
